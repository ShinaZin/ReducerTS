*   `app-scripts build` - build all for production
*   `app-scripts serve` - run dev server (served static client from `/build/..`)
*   `npm start` - start both client and server via `concurrently`
*   `cd client && npm start` - run dev client with hot reload via `react-scripts-ts`
*   `cd server && npm start` - run dev server (same as`app-scripts serve`)
